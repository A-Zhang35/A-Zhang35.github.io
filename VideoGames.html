        <h3>Player Unknowns Battlegrounds</h3>
        <p>My favorite game right now. It's just really fun, and each win is really satisfying considering how rare they are. Also one of the games I'm better than all my friends at. </p>

        <h3>Counter Strike Global Offensive</h3>
        <p>While I don't play this game much anymore, I still like it. The raw skill and talent required for this game is beyond me. I mostly watch the Esports scene in this game, as it's very competitive and fun. Let's go C9!</p>

        <h3>Fortnite</h3>
        <p>How could I leave fortnite off the list? While I'm complete garbage at this game, it's still really fun and I have a good time playing with my friends. The building is beyond me though, it's crazy how good some people are.</p>
