        <h3>Kobe Bryant</h3>
        <p>My all time favorite player is Kobe Bryant. Not just because of his 5 rings, dropping 81 in a game, or 2 scoring titles. His mentality, his toughness, all of that makes him my favorite player. </p>

        <h3>Kevin Durant</h3>
        <p>Even before he came to the warriors, I liked him. He plays like a 6'11 point guard, which is amazing. I just love his playstyle and he's one of the best to ever play the game.</p>

        <h3>Allen Iverson</h3>
        <p>Allen Iverson is a legend. This guy had the best handles of all time, and crossed over the best of them. One of my favorite players, not only because of his handles but becasue of his swagger and attitude.</p>
