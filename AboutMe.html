<h2>A little about me</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Andy. I'm 14 years old, and I go to Berkeley High school. This website is just a little about me and what I like. As you can probably tell, I like basketball, and video games. But, I also like reading and programming. This whole website building thing was confusing to me at first, as I'm new to HTML and Javascript, but eventually I got used to it. Hope you enjoy my website!</p>
<h2> Hobbies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Playing Guitar</li>
    <li>Eating Food</li>
    <li>Playing Basketball</li>
    <li>Sleeping</li>
</ul>
<h2>Later in Life</h2>
<p>When I was little, I wanted to be a NBA player when I grew up. Although I wish I could, I realize that it's impossible. So now, I don't really know what I want to be. A computer programmer would be cool, but right now, I'm  not sure what I want to be.</p>
